# Python Practice Projects
## About Me
I have experience in IT support, system administration, and hardware troubleshooting.
This repository is meant for **practice and learning**, not production use.


This repository contains my practice projects in Python.
I am improving my Python skills, building on my experience with other programming languages.

## Goals
- Learn Python for DevOps tasks: scripting, automation, and system management.
- Practice working with databases and simple applications.
- Explore Linux administration and cloud automation.

## Current Project(s)
- Day 1: foundational scripting and CLI patterns 
- Day 2: data processing and file I/O practice 
- Day 3: Blackjack (CLI practice): working with data structures, randomization, and functions.

## Skills Practiced
- Python basics: loops, functions, classes, modules
- Bash and command-line automation
- Docker: simple containers and scripts
- Database interaction: SQL queries, simple CRUD operations
- Networking fundamentals and server management

## Learning Roadmap
- Python Foundations
  - Write small CLI tools (args, input/output, error handling)
  - Organize code (modules, packages, simple tests)
- DevOps-Oriented Scripting
  - File processing, log parsing, subprocess usage
  - Environment variables, config files (YAML/JSON)
- Databases
  - Use sqlite3 for local CRUD and migrations
  - Practice parameterized queries and simple schema design
- Linux and Automation
  - System info scripts, service checks, cron-like scheduling
  - Shell integration (bash + Python), permissions, paths
- Containers
  - Containerize small scripts with minimal Dockerfiles
  - Basic images, volumes, and running scripts inside containers
- Networking
  - Simple TCP/HTTP requests and basic server scripts
